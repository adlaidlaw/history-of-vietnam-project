    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>This project shares the original Vietnamese text alongside its English translation.</p>
    <p>Note: After looking for an English translation and unable to find one, I decided to begin this project. As a poor reader of Vietnamese and with a great passion to understand the roots of my family and of my ethnicity, I wanted to reach farther back in history. I want to have strong, deep roots so that through any storm, I will have the resiliancy and clarity to grow forward into the unknown.<br>
     This project is intended to go through iterative editing phases. The first phase is a raw translation from Google Translate. Please expect errors. The second phase will receive careful reading and editing by someone with Vietnamese literacy (probably by my relatives).        </p>
